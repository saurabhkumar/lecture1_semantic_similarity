# Semantic Textual Similarity and Sentence Embeddings
Contains source code and slides used for a lecture on semantic similarity and sentence embeddings at the University of Applied Sciences, Augsburg, Germany.
The code is meant to introduce students to sentence embeddings and their usage for semantic textual similarity.
It is not prepared for being used directly for any projects.

For students: If you have problems in using the code, please free to contact me or Prof. Zarcone.
Enjoy experimenting with the code.
